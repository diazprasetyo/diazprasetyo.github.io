## Diaz Prasetyo | Data Scientist & Business Intelligence Expert

As a **Master of Data Science graduate from the [University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/)**, I bring a blend of advanced **machine learning, natural language processing, and visual analytics** expertise. My journey in data science was marked by my selection as a **Data Science & Analytics Scholar** for the [NSW Government Data Analytics Center](https://data.nsw.gov.au/nsw-data-analytics-centre), where I applied cutting-edge data techniques in a real-world policy environment. During my 6-month placement, I explored **data-driven policy compliance investigations** and developed **server performance visualizations** using tools like **SQL, Python, PowerBI**, and **Neo4j**, positioning myself as a problem-solver in complex data scenarios in several platform such as **Azure, Snowflake, and Databricks**.

In addition to my technical expertise, I thrive in leadership roles. As a **tutor at [the Business School of the University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/business/)**, I guided 60-80 students in mastering industry-standard tools like **SQL, BPMN, SAP,** and **Signavio**. My passion for teaching and data visualization led me to serve as a **[Tableau Student Ambassador](https://www.tableau.com/blog/introducing-tableau-ambassadors-2023#:~:text=Social%20Ambassador.-,Academic%20Ambassadors,-Academic%20Ambassadors%20are)**, where I facilitated workshops and helped others unlock the power of visual storytelling. You can explore my **Tableau** visualization in my [**Tableau Public Profile**](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/diaz.prasetyo/vizzes).

My professional journey includes leading data teams as a **Business Intelligence Manager** at **[eFishery](https://efishery.com/en/)**, where I contributed to the scaling of the Shrimp Business Unit by delivering strategic insights that directly impacted revenue and customer growth. From **mining operations** to **public health campaigns**, I’ve harnessed the power of data across diverse industries, driving operational efficiency and delivering actionable insights.

Beyond the world of data, I’m passionate about **cooking** (with inspirations from **Devina Hermawan** and **WillGoz**!) and love exploring **playgrounds** with my daughter.

I’m always open to new opportunities and collaborations! If you're looking for someone who can blend **data expertise** with **real-world impact**, feel free to [**message me on LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diazprasetyo/) or [**connect with me on YouTube**](https://www.youtube.com/@diazprasetyo).
